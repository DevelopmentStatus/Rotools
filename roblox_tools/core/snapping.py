"""Collision + snapping engine for the Roblox-style dragger.

Three layers, cheapest first:

  broad phase   world-AABB overlap (or a ray/AABB slab test) to decide which
                objects are worth looking at at all
  narrow phase  a per-object `BVHTree`, built lazily on first touch and cached
                for the lifetime of one drag - nothing but the dragged objects
                moves while a drag is running, so the cache stays valid and we
                never rebuild per frame
  fine pass     read the hit triangle's own corners straight out of the cached
                geometry and snap to those (the coarse -> fine handoff: the BVH
                narrows a whole object down to one triangle, then we look at
                that triangle's vertices and edge midpoints)

Trees are built in *world* space from the evaluated mesh. That costs one
transform at build time and buys two things: the hot loop never converts
between spaces, and a BVH face index maps directly back to the three
world-space corners of that triangle for the fine pass.

The synthetic ground is not a mesh - it is an analytic infinite Z-up plane, so
the dragger always has a surface to land on and you can never slide off the
edge of a finite stand-in quad.
